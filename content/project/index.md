During the last 4 years I have been working on the following projects: 
- <b> The role of attention on memory-based choice </b><br>
In this project I investigated if people look more or longer to better-remembered options. This was not the case. However, in choices from memory people rely much more on attention compared to non-memory-based choices

- <b> The role of uncertainty on memory-based choice </b><br>
In this pre-registered project I investigated if choices from memory ressemble choices from uncertaint (like risky lotteries). Indeed, I could observe a reflection effect: In the gain domain, people prefer better-remembered options, but in the loss domain, they prefer less-remembered options

- <b> Comparing choices across and within domains </b><br>
In this pre-registered project I am currently investigating what changes in the gaze behavior when people choose between two items from the same domain (two smartphones or two hotels) compared to choices between items from two different domains (choice between a smartphone and a hotel). We are currently collecting the data using eye-tracking. 

- <b> The interplay of two brain regions in memory-based choice </b><br>
In this project I reviewed the literature on the roles of the Hippocampus (classically known as the region for episodic memory consolidation and retrieval) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (classically known as the region responsible to evaluate choice options). Importantly, I was interesed on possible mechanisms how these two regions may interact in memory-based choice.
